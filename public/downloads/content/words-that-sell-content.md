These 101 power words are organized by the emotion they evoke. Choose words that match:

1. **The property type** (luxury, family, modern, investment, starter)
2. **The target buyer** (families, professionals, investors, first-timers)
3. **The key selling points** (location, features, lifestyle, value)

**Pro Tip:** Use 3-5 power words per listing. Too many dilutes their impact.
