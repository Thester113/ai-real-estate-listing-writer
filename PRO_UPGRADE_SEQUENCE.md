### Email 1: The Time Audit (Day 15 after signup)
**Subject:** How much is your time worth? ⏰

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much is your time worth per hour?

If you're like most successful real estate agents, it's probably $100-300+ per hour.

So here's a thought experiment...

**THE LISTING DESCRIPTION TIME AUDIT:**

Before PropertyWriter:
• Research comparable properties: 15 minutes
• Write first draft: 20 minutes  
• Edit and refine: 10 minutes
• **Total: 45 minutes per listing**

After PropertyWriter:
• Input property details: 2 minutes
• Generate AI description: 30 seconds
• Quick review and edit: 2 minutes
• **Total: 5 minutes per listing**

**Time saved per listing: 40 minutes**

If you write 10 listings per month:
40 minutes × 10 = 400 minutes = 6.7 hours saved

At $150/hour, that's $1,000 in time value every month.

PropertyWriter Pro costs $29/month.

**ROI: 3,448%**

But here's what really matters...

Those 6+ hours you save? You can spend them on:
→ More client meetings
→ Additional showings  
→ Building relationships
→ Actually selling homes

The question isn't whether you can afford PropertyWriter Pro.

It's whether you can afford NOT to have it.

Ready to get those hours back?

Time is your most valuable asset,

### Email 2: ROI Calculator (Day 18)
**Subject:** PropertyWriter Pro pays for itself in 2 listings 💰

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Let me show you the math that made me build PropertyWriter Pro...

**THE 2-LISTING PAYBACK:**

Average commission per listing: $3,000
PropertyWriter Pro: $29/month

If Pro helps you close just ONE extra deal every 25 months, it pays for itself.

But here's what actually happens:

**SARAH'S RESULTS (Keller Williams, Austin):**
• Before Pro: 8 listings/month average
• After Pro: 12 listings/month average  
• Increase: 4 extra listings × $3,000 = $12,000/month
• Pro cost: $29/month
• **Net gain: $11,971/month**

**How did she do it?**

1. **Bulk Generation**: Listed an entire new development in 30 minutes
2. **Analytics**: Discovered "chef's kitchen" gets 3x more clicks in her market
3. **Multiple Formats**: Created MLS descriptions, social posts, and brochures instantly

"I used to dread writing listings. Now I generate 20 in the time it used to take me to write 1. My listing volume tripled." - Sarah M.

**THE COMPOUND EFFECT:**

Better descriptions → More qualified leads → Faster sales → More referrals → Higher volume → Increased income

It's not just about the $29/month.

It's about unlocking your potential to scale.

**EXCLUSIVE PRO FEATURES:**
✅ Bulk generation (50+ listings at once)
✅ Performance analytics dashboard
✅ Multiple export formats
✅ Neighborhood market data integration
✅ Priority support
✅ Advanced customization options

### Email 5: Objection Handler (Day 30)
**Subject:** "I'm not sure if Pro is worth it..." 🤔

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

I get it.

$29/month for a listing tool might seem like a lot.

Let me address the most common concerns I hear:

**💭 "I don't write that many listings"**

Fair point. But here's the thing...

Even if you only write 5 listings per month, Pro saves you 3+ hours. If your time is worth $100/hour, that's $300 in time value for $29.

Plus, better descriptions = more engagement = faster sales = more referrals.

**💭 "I'm good at writing descriptions myself"**

You probably are! Pro isn't about replacing your skills—it's about amplifying them.

Think of it like a luxury car. You can drive just fine without leather seats and GPS, but why would you want to?

Pro gives you:
• Market data you don't have time to research
• Psychology-based word choices proven to work
• Consistent quality even when you're rushed
• Analytics to improve your own writing

**💭 "The free version works fine"**

It does! But "fine" and "exceptional" are different.

The free version gets you from A to B.
Pro gets you there faster, with better results, and frees up time for what really matters—selling homes.

**💭 "I need to think about it"**

I respect that. But here's what I've learned from 1,000+ real estate professionals:

The agents who succeed fastest are the ones who invest in tools that give them an edge.

While you're "thinking about it," your competitors are using Pro to:
→ Generate better listings faster
→ Understand what works in their market  
→ Scale their business efficiently

**THE DECISION REALLY COMES DOWN TO THIS:**

Do you want to spend your time writing descriptions...
Or selling homes?
