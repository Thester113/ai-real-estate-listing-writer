**Title:** The Ultimate Property Listing Writing Guide
**Subtitle:** How to Write Descriptions That Sell Homes 30% Faster
**By:** PropertyWriter Team

### Pages 2-3: The $10,000 Mistake
- **The Problem:** Most agents write features, not benefits
- **Example Comparison:**
  - ❌ "3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home with updated kitchen"
  - ✅ "Wake up refreshed in your private master retreat, then brew morning coffee in a chef-inspired kitchen that makes every meal a celebration"
- **The Science:** Psychology of emotional decision-making in home purchases

### Pages 4-6: The HOMES Formula
**H** - Hook (first 10 words must create curiosity)
**O** - Overview (paint the lifestyle picture)  
**M** - Must-haves (key features that matter)
**E** - Emotion (make them feel at home)
**S** - Scarcity (create urgency to act)

### Pages 7-10: Power Words by Room
**Kitchen Power Words:**
- Chef-inspired, culinary haven, entertaining hub, gourmet paradise

**Living Room Power Words:**  
- Gathering space, relaxation retreat, entertainment oasis, cozy sanctuary

**Bedroom Power Words:**
- Private suite, peaceful haven, restful retreat, personal sanctuary

**Bathroom Power Words:**
- Spa-like escape, rejuvenating oasis, luxurious retreat, wellness sanctuary

### Pages 11-13: The Psychology Triggers
1. **Scarcity:** "Only 3 homes sold in this neighborhood last year"
2. **Social Proof:** "Consistently ranked #1 school district"
3. **Loss Aversion:** "Before someone else discovers this gem"
4. **Future Pacing:** "Imagine hosting holidays in this space"

### Pages 14-16: Neighborhood Goldmine
- How to research and include local selling points
- School district language that sells
- Commute and convenience positioning

- "Architecturally significant," "executive retreat," "entertainer's paradise"

### Pages 20-22: Common Mistakes That Kill Sales
1. **TMI Syndrome** - Too much information overwhelms buyers
2. **Feature Dumping** - Listing specs without emotional connection
3. **Generic Language** - "Nice home" says nothing

## 📋 LEAD MAGNET 2: "Listing Mistakes That Cost Sales"

### Hook: "The 7 Words That Make Buyers Click Away"

**15-Page Quick-Read Checklist:**

### The 7 Deadly Listing Words:
1. **"Cozy"** = Small/Cramped
